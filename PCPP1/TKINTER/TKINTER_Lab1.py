Objectives
Learn practical skills related to:

- using the Entry, Radiobutton and Button widgets,
- managing widgets with the grid manager,
- checking the validity of user input and handling errors.

Scenario
You need a calculator. A very simple and very specific calculator. Look at the
picture - it contains two fields that the user can use to enter arguments, a
radio button to select the operation to perform, and a button initiating
the evaluation:

Calculator - reference


We expect the calculator to behave in the following way:

- if both fields contain valid (integer or float) numbers, clicking the
Evaluate button should display an info window showing the evaluation's result;
- if any of the fields contains invalid data (e.g., a string, or a field is
empty), clicking the Evaluate button should present an error window describing
the problem, and the focus should be moved to the field causing the problem.
- Don't forget to protect your code from dividing by zero, and use the grid
manager to compose the window interior.
