"""
The code presented in the editor shows how to use the class method as an
alternative constructor, allowing you to handle an additional argument.

The including_brand method is a class method, and expects a call with two
parameters ('vin' and 'brand'). The first parameter is used to create an object
using the standard __init__ method.

In accordance with the convention, the creation of a class object (i.e.,
calling the __init__ method, among other things) is done using cls(vin).

Then the class method performs an additional task â€“ in this case, it
supplements the brand instance variable and finally returns the newly
created object.
