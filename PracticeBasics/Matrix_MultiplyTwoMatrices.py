"""
Given two matrix the task is that we will have to create a program to
multiply two matrices in python.

Examples:

Input : X = [[1, 7, 3],
             [3, 5, 6],
             [6, 8, 9]]
       Y = [[1, 1, 1, 2],
           [6, 7, 3, 0],
           [4, 5, 9, 1]]

Output : [55, 65, 49, 5]
         [57, 68, 72, 12]
         [90, 107, 111, 21]
