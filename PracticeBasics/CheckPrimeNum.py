"""
Given a positive integer N, The task is to write a Python program to check if the number is Prime or not in Python.

Examples:

Input:  n = 11
Output: True


Input:  n = 1
Output: False

Explanation: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that
 has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
  The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.
